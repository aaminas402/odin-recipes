    <h3>A south Indian Breakfast dish made from rice</h3>
    <p> 
        Puttu is a traditional South Indian dish, especially popular in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, made by steaming layers of coarsely ground rice flour and grated coconut.
        This cylindrical delicacy is soft, crumbly, and mildly flavored, making it a versatile breakfast option. Often served with kadala curry (spiced black chickpeas),
        ripe bananas, or even drizzled with ghee and sugar, puttu offers a delightful balance of textures and flavors. Its preparation, using minimal oil and no frying,
        makes it a healthy choice. Whether enjoyed with savory curries or sweet accompaniments, puttu embodies the simplicity and richness of South Indian cuisine.
