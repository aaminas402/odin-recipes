    <h3>A south Indian Fluffy dish made from rice</h3>
    <p> 
        Idli is a soft, fluffy, steamed rice cake that holds a cherished place in South Indian cuisine and is enjoyed across India as a nutritious and light breakfast dish.
        Made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram), idli is a perfect blend of taste and health. Its spongy texture and subtle flavor pair beautifully with
        tangy sambar, creamy coconut chutney, or a drizzle of ghee and podi (spiced lentil powder). Known for its easy digestibility and balanced nutrition, idli is a versatile
        meal, often seen as a comfort food. Simple yet wholesome, it’s a staple that reflects the culinary wisdom of traditional Indian kitchens.
